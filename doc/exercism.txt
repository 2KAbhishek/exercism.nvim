    exercism.setup({
        exercism_workspace = '~/exercism', -- Default workspace for exercism exercises
        default_language = 'ruby', -- Default language for exercise list

    })
<


COMMANDS ~

`exercism.nvim` provides a unified command interface with tab completion:

- `Exercism languages` - Lists all available languages, select one to list exercises
- `Exercism list [language]` - Lists exercises for the specified language, show exercises for default language if not specified
- `Exercism test` - Runs tests for the current exercise
- `Exercism submit` - Submits the current exercise
- `Exercism open <language> <exercise>` - Opens a specific exercise directly in the specified language
- `Exercism exercise <exercise>` - Opens a specific exercise directly using the default language
- `Exercism recents` - Shows recently opened exercises in a fuzzy searchable list


KEYBINDINGS ~

Here are the default keybindings:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Keybinding    Command                    Description
  ------------- -------------------------- ------------------------------------
  <leader>exa   Exercism languages         List all available languages

  <leader>exl   Exercism list [language]   List exercises for the specified
                                           language

  <leader>ext   Exercism test              Run tests for the current exercise

  <leader>exs   Exercism submit            Submit the current exercise

  You can change these by setting `add_default_keybindings` to `false` and adding
  your own keybindings.

INSPIRATION ~

I really like exercism but the back and forth between the browser and the
terminal was a bit annoying. So I decided to integrate it with Neovim.


CHALLENGES/LEARNINGS ~

- I build exercism-fetcher <https://github.com/2kabhishek/exercism-fetcher> to fetch exercises from exercism’s github repos.
- Reused knowledge from octohub.nvim, not too many challenges here.


MORE INFO ~

- octohub.nvim <https://github.com/2kabhishek/octohub.nvim> — GitHub Repos in Neovim
- nerdy.nvim <https://github.com/2kabhishek/nerdy.nvim> — Find nerd glyphs easily
- tdo.nvim <https://github.com/2KAbhishek/tdo.nvim> — Fast and simple notes in Neovim
- termim.nvim <https://github.com/2kabhishek/termim.nvim> — Neovim terminal improved
